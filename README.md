# IO-Bot-v3

A Discord bot that runs input/output games, written using the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) API library. \
Choose a function to start a game. Let players query or guess function values, then submit a function to win the game!

First two versions unfortunately ditched due to unfamiliarity with the library, resulting in spaghetti code.
